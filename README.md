# Zeitman_autofill
Filling out Zeitman is boring. This script might make some of the pain go away.

# Requirements
The `selenium` package and Chrome webdriver must be installed to use this script.

# Usage
Script autofills working hours based on some average start and end times plus some user-defined random noise.

Weekends and holidays are ignored, but currently all working hours are set to "present". No teleworking option yet.

Warning: it will only work if your Zeitman language is set to English. And even then I make no promises.

# Contributions
Anyone is more than welcome to make it better
